    This class contains functions needed to:
     (1) craft and send DNS queries of a specific type for a specific domain to a specific resolver.
     (2) parse and save the IP addresses from the DNS responses.

    You will find the DNS and DNSQR classes from scapy.layers.dns helpful for crafting a DNS query packet.
    You will find the sr1 method from scapy.all helpful for sending and receiving packets.
    You will find the `dir()` method helpful to explore the structure and attributes of the packets received.
        Read more about `dir()` here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir
