"""
Note: Scapy does not use the TCP implementation made available by the Kernel.

This has implications for the way you deal with the TCP handshake.
- Scapy sends out its own SYN (unbeknownst to your kernel)
- The Kernel and Scapy receives the SYN/ACK. This is unexpected to the kernel
    so it sends a TCP RST and shuts down the connection (making it unusable
    for Scapy).

To circumvent this problem, you should have TCP RST packets from your kernel
blocked. This means the outgoing RST from your kernel to the server gets dropped
by the kernel "firewall" ==> the connection stays open for scapy to use.

Run:
`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -s <your IP from 'ifconfig'> -j DROP`
in the command line of your Linux VM.

            and contains an appropriate sequence number and source port. Once you have
            this packet you will find an appropriate Scapy function to send this packet

            back to the server with the ACK flag set and the appropriate sequence and
